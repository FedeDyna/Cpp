We study the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) measurements of a planetary system
of two super-Earths detected as Kepler-29, in order to constrain the planets'
masses and orbital parameters of the this system. A dynamical analysis of the
best-fitting configurations reveal that the system may be locked in the 9:7~mean
motion resonance. However, a variety of orbital architectures regarding
eccentricities and the relative orientation of orbits is permitted by the
observations as well as by stability constraints. We attempt to find
configurations prefered by the planet formation scenarios as an additional,
physical constraint. We show that configurations with low eccentricities and
anti-aligned apsidal lines of the orbits are a natural and most likely outcome
of the convergent migration.
