We study the orbital architecture, physical characteristics of planets,  formation and long-term evolution of the Kepler-30 planetary system, detected and announced in 2012 by the \kepler{} team.  We show  that it belongs to particular class of very compact and quasi-resonant, yet long-term stable planetary systems. 
We re-analysed light curves of the host star spanning Q1-Q17 quarters. A huge variability of the Transit Timing Variations (TTV) exceeding 2~days is induced by a massive Jovian planet located between two Neptune-like companions. The innermost pair is near to the 2:1 mean motion resonance (MMR), and the outermost pair is close to the 19:8~MMR. 

Our re-analysis of photometric data allows us to constrain better than before the orbital elements, planets' radii and masses, which are $9.2 \pm 0.1$, $536 \pm 5$, and $23.7 \pm 1.3$ Earth masses for Kepler-30b, Kepler-30c and Kepler-30d, respectively. The masses of the inner planets are determined within $\sim 1\%$ uncertainty. We inferred the internal structures of the Kepler-30 planets and their bulk densities in a wide range from $\sim0.19 \pm 0.01$\gccm{} for Kepler-30d, $\sim0.96\pm0.15$\gccm{} for Kepler-30b,  to $\sim1.71 \pm 0.13$\gccm{} for Jovian planet Kepler-30c, respectively.  

We attempt to explain the origin of this unique planetary system and a deviation of the orbits from exact MMRs by the planetary migration scenario. We anticipate that the Jupiter-like planet plays an important role in determining the present dynamical state of this system.
